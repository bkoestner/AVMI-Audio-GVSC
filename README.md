# AVMI-Audio-GVSC
This is the offical github for the AVMI Lab's GVSC Audio Sytem project. As more features and development happens I will update with more nomeclature.
I am currently working on setting up the filing system and the project to make sure old versions of the simulation are available.

Each New Working Version of the Unreal Engine Software should be uploaded under "Releases"
This gives access to the version to everyone while allowing us to go back to an older version.
Correct Naming for Releases shoulld be: AVMI_[Initials]_[Date]_VX.X
                               Example: AVMI_BK_09.04.24_V1.0
